## SportIsLife

### Information system for playing sports with strangers:
  This repository contains the seminar materials and documentation for SportIsLife, an Information system designed to help people find nearby sport surfaces and match up with others for quick games/matches.

### About the seminar:
  - The seminar presents the development process, functional and non-functional requirements, feasibility study and system design, including ER diagrams, UML models and data flow analysis.
  - React Native and Node.js are used to implement each functionality of the Information System.

Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the actual repository of the project. The application was running on the university server, which I can no longer access, meaning the system is no longer functional. However, this repository serves as documentation of the development process, system architecture, and design decisions.


Here's the demo video of the application:
