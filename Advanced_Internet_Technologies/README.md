## LAB 1: IPv6 Network Configuration with Mininet

### Course: Advanced Internet Technologies

### Description: 

Configuration of IPv6 networks in a virtual environment using Mininet.
Assigning IPv6 addresses, analyzing generated traffic and comparing it with IPv4, managing routing tables, and testing communication between virtual hosts.
Experiments on IPv6 address duplication and routing table management for inter-subnet communication.

## LAB 2: Virtual Private Networks (VPN)

### Course: Advanced Internet Technologies

### Description: 

Configuration and use of an L2TP and IPsec-based VPN
Network traffic analysis before and after enabling the VPN to verify the change in public IP address and the routing of traffic through the VPN server.

#### Experiments conducted:
  - Configuring the VPN with the provided parameters.
  - Analyzing the IP address before and after connecting to the VPN.
  - Modifying the routing table to examine how traffic is routed through the VPN.
  - Using Wireshark to analyze the authentication process and verify if the data is encrypted.
  - Inspecting network traffic on both the physical network and the VPN to confirm packet encryption.
  - Analyzing webpage loading with and without the VPN to check for differences in response times and contacted IP addresses.

## LAB 3: Performance Analysis of HTTP and QUIC

### Course: Advanced Internet Technologies

### Description: 

Experiments on TCP, HTTP (various versions), and QUIC to evaluate their performance.
Using tools such as Google Chrome Debugger, BrowserTime, and curl to inspect HTTP transactions, perform web scraping, and measure webpage performance across different protocols.

#### Experiments conducted:
  - Analyzing HTTP traffic using Google Chrome Debugger.
  - Scraping weather data with curl and Bash tools.
  - Measuring webpage loading performance with BrowserTime, testing different protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3).
  - Comparing webpage loading times across different HTTP versions.
  - Applying artificial network delays to observe their impact on loading performance.
